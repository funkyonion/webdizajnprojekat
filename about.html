              Hello everyone! My name is Natalija and I am based in Belgrade,
              Serbia. Currently I am studying Computer Multimedia at an
              Information Technology School, and in my spare time I love to
              focus on 3D modelling and fortography. I had been studying
              classical languages (Ancient Greek as well as Latin) in High
              School, but decided to switch my career path towards the IT
              industry, more speciifally design, since I have a sharp eye for
              detail and am guided by my creativity. One of my main hobbies is
              playing video games, therefore I would say I have great problem
              solving skills and am a great team worker.
